 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n3'
 *
 * Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, whereÂ kÂ is
 * non-negative.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
 * Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
 * Explanation:
 * rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
 * rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
 * Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
 * Explanation:
 * rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
 * rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different
 * ways to solve this problem.
 * Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
