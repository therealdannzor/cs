 *
 * Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as
 * one sorted array.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n
 * respectively.
 * You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to
 * m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *
 * Input:
 * nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
 * nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
 *
 * Output:Â [1,2,2,3,5,6]

	// last element of first and second slice, respectively
	lastFir := m - 1
